Hi. I am a research associate at the <a href="https://www.cais-research.de/" target="_blank">Center for Advanced Internet Studies</a> (Germany) in the research groups ‘Social Cohesion in Digital Media Environments’ and ‘Research Data and Methods’. As a PhD student at the <a href="https://compcommlab.univie.ac.at/" target="_blank">‘Computational Communication Science Lab’</a> at the University of Vienna, I am investigating the chances and challenges of automating racism detection in textual data. My research interests include the interplay between social bias and CSS and other methodological questions, as well as media discourses on topics such as polarization, migration and other political phenomena.
