Hi. I am a research associate at the <a href="https://www.cais-research.de/" target="_blank">Center for Advanced Internet Studies</a> (Germany) in the research groups ‘Social Cohesion in Digital Media Environments’ and ‘Research Data and Methods’. As a PhD student at the <a href="https://compcommlab.univie.ac.at/" target="_blank">‘Computational Communication Science Lab’</a> at the University of Vienna, I am investigating the chances and challenges of automating racism detection in textual data. Further, I am an external lecturer at <a href="https://www.sozwiss.hhu.de/" target ="_blank">Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf</a>. My research interests include political phenomena such as polarization and migration in mediated discourses, as well as methodological questions relating to social bias and Computational Social Science.<br>
