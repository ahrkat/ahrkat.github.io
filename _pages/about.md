HI.
======
Hi. I am a research associate in the research programme “Societal Cohesion in Digital Media Environments” at the Center for Advanced Internet Studies (CAIS) and focus on polarization and societal cohesion. As a PhD student at the Computational Communication Science Lab at the University of Vienna, I am researching the potentials and challenges of automated detection of discrimination and hate speech. My research interests also include political phenomena in media discourses and methodological questions, especially in the field of automated content analysis and computational social science. 

coming up.
